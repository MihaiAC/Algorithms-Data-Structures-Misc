Downsides of using linked lists:
- allocation/deallocation overhead;
- lost locality of reference (unless backing it with an efficient, contiguous allocator);

Downside of using (circular) arrays:
- When it needs excess capacity and copies;
- If the data set is huge, it can throw some memory errors;

Downsides of using Unrolled List:
- Stores some excess capacity in nodes, which might be wasteful;
